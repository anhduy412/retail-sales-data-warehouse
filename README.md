# sales-data-warehouse

This is the ultimate project of how to create a data warehouse, step by step. The case study is Retail Sales. Also, this project is a part of the Internship program, KPIM, and this is the first ever project of creating a data warehouse. 

In this project, I used Python 3.11.3 with 2 core libraries: Pandas and PyODBC; Microsoft SQL Server 2022 edition and some of my luck to create the data warehouse.

I want to give a big shoutout to Mr Hai Hoang Nguyen, CTO of KPIM, for the idea, data, and the help in creating the most optimisation data warehouse. Another big shoutout to Nghia, Hieu for some cool ideas of declaring dimension table and fact table. 
For the last shoutout, I want to give it to the Kimball Group for writing such a great “The Data Warehouse Toolkit (3rd edition)”, which is one of the greatest books about data I’ve ever read, and Mr Thang L. D. for the “Lý thuyết và thực hành thiết kế kho dữ liệu” (Designing data warehouse: theory and practice) document, which is a great document also.

Finally, this is my first time ever of creating a data warehouse, and it’s inevitable to cause some mistake, even if it’s stupid or no, so if you have any recommendation, please message me in Teams, Telegram (@anhduy412) or E-mail (both Outlook and Gmail).
